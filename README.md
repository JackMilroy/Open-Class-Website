# Open-Class-Website
  This is the class website for Mr. Rice's Engineering Class. Individual student pages and group project pages will be hosted from here.

  The class officially titled "<a href='http://www.mayfieldschools.org/Downloads/Course%20Catalog%20-%202015-2016.pdf'>
Explorations in Engineering</a>" in the Mayfield course handbook is constantly under development. 
This website will serve as a hub to see where all of this content comes together for each of the 
different students that are enrolled in the course. Things will likely change year-to-year, and 
each individual student's journey will be unique. Here we can share that work for all to see and 
to maintain for future learners.
