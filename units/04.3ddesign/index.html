                <h1>3D design</h1>
                <p>
                    There are many different 3D design softwares, with only minor differences between their core functions. Most differences only arise because the programs are developed by different companies. A few are free and open-source programs. most have license arrangements that allow free student or hobby use, with a public account.

                <p>
                    There are some basic skills that are needed with all graphical 3D design software:

                            <li>Sketches can be drawn on existing flat surfaces of the model</li>
                            <li>Sketches can be drawn on insterted planes, placed in/on the part by the user</li>

                            <li>*All shapes on the sketch need to be 'closed' in order to cut or extrude</li>
                            <li>*Extrusions and cuts have options to move away from their originating sketch in various amounts and directions</li>
                            <li>*There are many more skills around the basic Extrusion and Cut actions</li>

                    <li>There are advanced options to edit 3D models that often vary per software</li>

                            <li>*There are usually many more advanced options, but these vary with each type of software...</li>
