        <h1>3D design</h1>
        <p>
            There are many different 3D design softwares, with only minor differences between their core functions. Most differences only arise because the programs are developed by different companies. A few are free and open-source programs. most have license arrangements that allow free student or hobby use, with a public account.

            There are some basic skills that are needed with all graphical 3D design software: 
        </p>
        <ol style='line-height:150%;'>
            <li>Understanding the filetypes for parts</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The file type for a single part</li>
                    <li>The file type for 'assemblies' of multiple parts together</li>
                    <li>The STL file type for storing geometry only (used for 3D printing)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Drawing 2D sketches before extrusion or cutting</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sketches can be drawn on a starting plane</li>
                    <li>Sketches can be drawn on existing flat surfaces of the model</li>
                    <li>Sketches can be drawn on insterted planes, placed in/on the part by the user</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Extrusion and cutting of the model, from a sketch</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extrusion adds material to the model</li>
                    <li>Cutting removes material, as the opposite of an extrusion</li>
                    <li>*All shapes on the sketch need to be 'closed' in order to cut or extrude</li>
                    <li>*Extrusions and cuts have options to move away from their originating sketch in various amounts and directions</li>
                    <li>*There are many more skills around the basic Extrusion and Cut actions</li>
                </ul>
            <li>There are advanced options to edit 3D models that often vary per software</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Linear Arrays to expand a grid of model properties</li>
                    <li>Circular Arrays to expand a circular pattern of model properties</li>
                    <li>Loft to extrude in a nonlinear direction</li>
                    <li>Shell to remove a side and hollow out a shape (to a specified thickness)</li>
                    <li>Bevel/ Chambfer to curve or angle the edges of a shape</li>
                    <li>*There are usually many more advanced options, but these vary with each type of software...</li>
